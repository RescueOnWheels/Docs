\section{Problem, need and advantages}

\subsection{Problem}
The moment an earthquake happens or a bomb goes off the location is considered dangerous. On said site other people should not be put in danger too. Nevertheless the places where victims might be stuck could be not easily reachable by humans. And even if the location is easily accessible, another disaster could be triggered by a heavy object such as a human.

\subsection{Need}
Given the previous stated problem the idea of a robot. The robot we will design will be a semi-remote-controlled unit the size of a big cat. The rover will be able to explore a disaster-site with ease due to its small size. In addition to its size we'll design the rover with a special treat, being a pan-tilt camera.

\subsection{Advantages}
The fact that that a disposable robot can be put in danger compared to a person is a great advantage. The size --and thus the weight-- of the robot will be a factor that makes rescues a lot more likely to succeed. Additionally the pan-tilt camera module enables the operator to use virtual-reality to emerge in the site.
