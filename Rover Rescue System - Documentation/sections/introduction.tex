\section{Introduction}
In the (near) future robots will be more and more part of our daily life. Even more than they are already part of society today. Industrial robots are nowadays very common, the use of drones by military and civilians triggers discussion and science is creating robots to take care of people who need help. Functioning more or less autonomous requires that such machines have to be robust, take their own decisions and operate in a safe way. 

Thus we created a robot that helps to rescue people trapped in a collapsed building.

The user is able to control the robot using the combination of a controller, specifically a Steam Controller, and a moblie phone as display used by the Google Cardboard. Of course, being a robot, the robot itself wants to do as much as possible. The degree of autonomy of the robot has been focused on assisting the user as much as possible.
