\section{Installation}
To install the application you will first need to enable app installation from unknown sources. Where these settings are located may vary per device and different Android versions.\newline
\newline
After enabling installation from unknown sources you need to download the APK-file onto your device. The easiest way of doing this is by going to the latest release page of the app, \href{https://github.com/RescueOnWheels/Tincidunt/releases/latest}{click here}. An alternative would be by downloading the APK on your computer and to transfer it via an USB-cable.\newline
\newline
After downloading/transferring the APK-file onto the phone you will need to open it. This can be done via the build in file explorer or a third-party file explorer.
