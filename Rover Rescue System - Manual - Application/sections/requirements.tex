\section{Requirements}
In order to install and use the Android app your device will need to have the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Android 6.X.X. or higher;
	\item Support for OpenGL 2.0 at minimum.
	\item Gyroscope built-in;
	\item Minimum screen size of 4.0";
	\item Maximum screen size of 5.3";	
\end{itemize}

We will recommend a high-tier smartphone for the best experience as they tend to have to best screen quality. Another requirement is to have a Google Cardboard, other options are available but we don't support and recommend them.
