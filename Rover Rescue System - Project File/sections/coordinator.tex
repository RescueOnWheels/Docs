We went to all of the progress meetings with the main stakeholder Ed Kuijpers.

\subsection{Sprint 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Kick-off project.
	\item Stakeholder approved use of ZenHub instead of Trello, Hexo instead of Tumblr and GitHub instead of GitLab but a clone had to be available at the end of the project.
	\item Requested clarification on the requested functionality.
	\item Discussed the status of the provided Rovers (all broken) with the stakeholder.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint 2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requested clarification on the C/C++ knowledge at the technical meeting. Resulted in not having to know any C/C++ except all which had been provided through the workshops or provided code.
	\item Scrum process was given a negative grade, no comment available from the stakeholder why it was insufficient.
	\item Discussed excellence track for us (non-excellence students), stakeholder was really negative about having such ambitions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint 3}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Discussed the status of the provided magnetometers (all broken) with the stakeholder.
	\item Requested clarification on using Virtual Reality as control for the Rover/Robot, stakeholder approved.
	\item Requested workshop on S.L.A.M. and Facial recognition, both turned down due to limited knowledge and time.
	\item More information about the design trade-offs for the Rover and its environment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint 4}
TBD
